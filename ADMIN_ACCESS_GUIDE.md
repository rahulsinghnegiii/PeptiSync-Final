## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Access Denied" When Visiting /admin

**Possible Causes:**
1. User doesn't have admin/moderator role
2. User needs to logout and login again
3. Role wasn't assigned correctly

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Role in Database**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     u.email,
     ur.role
   FROM auth.users u
   LEFT JOIN user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id
   WHERE u.email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```

2. **Assign Admin Role**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
   SELECT id, 'admin'
   FROM auth.users
   WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com'
   ON CONFLICT (user_id) 
   DO UPDATE SET role = 'admin';
   ```

3. **Clear Session and Login Again**
   - Logout from the app
   - Clear browser cache/cookies
   - Login again
   - Try accessing `/admin`

### Issue: Role Changes Not Taking Effect

**Solution:**
- Logout and login again
- The role is checked on each page load
- Session needs to be refreshed

### Issue: Can't Find User Email

  email,
  created_at,
  email_confirmed_at
FROM auth.users
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
