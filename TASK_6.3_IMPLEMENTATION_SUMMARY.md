   - Implemented with interactive star rating and textarea

✅ **Add Zod validation (min 10 chars, max 500 chars)**
   - Validation schema enforces:
     - Rating: 1-5 stars (required)
     - Comment: 10-500 characters (required)

✅ **Check if user has purchased product before allowing review**
   - Uses `useUserPurchasedProduct` hook

   - Only allows review submission for verified purchases

✅ **Implement review submission mutation**
   - Uses `useSubmitReview` for new reviews
   - Uses `useUpdateReview` for editing existing reviews

✅ **Update product rating after review submission**
   - Handled automatically by database trigger (from migration)
   - Query invalidation ensures UI updates with new ratings

## Database Integration

The implementation leverages the existing database schema:

### Reviews Table:
- `id`: UUID primary key
- `user_id`: References auth.users
- `product_id`: References products
- `rating`: Integer (1-5)
- `comment`: Text (10-500 chars)
- `is_verified_purchase`: Boolean
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps
- Unique constraint on (user_id, product_id)

### Database Triggers:
- `update_product_rating_on_insert`: Updates product rating when review is added
- `update_product_rating_on_update`: Updates product rating when review is edited
- `update_product_rating_on_delete`: Updates product rating when review is deleted

### RLS Policies:
- Anyone can view reviews
- Users can create reviews for purchased products
- Users can update/delete their own reviews
- Admins can delete any review

## User Experience Flow

1. **User browses store** → Clicks product card or "View Details"
2. **Product detail page loads** → Shows product info and reviews
3. **User scrolls to reviews section** → Sees ReviewForm and existing reviews
4. **ReviewForm checks**:
   - Is user signed in? → If not, show "Please sign in" message
   - Has user purchased product? → If not, show "Only purchased products" message
   - Does user have existing review? → If yes, load it for editing
5. **User submits review**:
   - Validates rating (1-5 stars required)
   - Validates comment (10-500 characters)
   - Submits to database with verified purchase flag
   - Database trigger updates product rating
   - UI refreshes to show new review
   - Success toast notification

## Testing Recommendations

To test the implementation:

1. **Sign in as a user**
2. **Navigate to a product detail page** (e.g., `/store/{product-id}`)
3. **Verify purchase check**:
   - If you haven't purchased, should show "Only purchased products" message
   - Create a test order to verify purchase verification works
4. **Submit a review**:
   - Try submitting with < 10 characters → Should show validation error
   - Try submitting with > 500 characters → Should show validation error
   - Try submitting without rating → Should show validation error
   - Submit valid review → Should succeed and show in reviews list
5. **Edit review**:
   - Refresh page → Form should load with existing review
   - Edit and submit → Should update successfully
6. **Verify rating update**:
   - Check that product rating updates after review submission
   - Check that review count increments
