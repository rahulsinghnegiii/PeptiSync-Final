PeptiSync – Weight Loss & Metabolic Peptides
Semaglutide
Category: GLP-1 Receptor Agonist • Metabolic Support • Appetite Regulation

Description:
Semaglutide is a peptide that acts on GLP-1 receptors, a natural hormone involved in appetite control, blood sugar balance, and metabolic signaling. In wellness settings, it is commonly used to support weight-management efforts by helping individuals feel fuller for longer and reducing overeating tendencies. Research suggests semaglutide may also play a role in supporting metabolic efficiency, though effects can vary from person to person.

Because of its longer half-life, semaglutide is typically used once weekly. Many individuals report improved appetite control, more stable eating patterns, and better adherence to nutrition goals when this peptide is included as part of a broader wellness plan.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 0.25 mg once weekly (introductory range)
• Titration to 0.5 mg → 1.0 mg → 1.7 mg weekly
• Some advanced users report 2.0–2.4 mg weekly, though side effects may increase at higher levels

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• Weeks 1–4: 0.25 mg once weekly
• Weeks 5–8: 0.5 mg once weekly
• After Week 8: Some individuals slowly increase toward 1.0 mg weekly or higher based on tolerance and goals

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Common sites: abdomen, thigh, or upper arm
• Rotate injection sites weekly
• Store reconstituted vials in the refrigerator

Notes:
• Not typically combined with other GLP-1 or GIP agonists (such as tirzepatide or retatrutide)
• Slow dose escalation may help reduce nausea or GI discomfort
• Smaller meals and adequate hydration may support tolerability
