PeptiSync – Mitochondrial & Longevity Peptides (Document 4)
MOTS‑C
Category: Mitochondrial Peptide • Energy Balance • Cellular Wellness

Description:
MOTS‑C is a naturally occurring peptide derived from mitochondrial DNA. In wellness settings, individuals explore MOTS‑C for its potential role in supporting energy balance, cellular resilience, and metabolic steadiness. Early research suggests possible effects on mitochondrial signaling and exercise capacity, though human evidence is still developing.

Users often describe MOTS‑C as subtle, with gradual changes rather than sudden boosts.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 5–15 mg per week total
• Often divided into 2–3 injections weekly

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 5 mg subcutaneous injection, 2–3× weekly
• 2–6 week cycles are common in wellness routines

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Store reconstituted peptide in the refrigerator

Notes:
• Often used during increased training or wellness phases
• Effects may be enhanced when paired with regular exercise and nutrition routines

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide.
SS‑31 (Elamipretide)
Category: Mitochondrial Support Peptide • Cellular Protection • Longevity Research

Description:
SS‑31 (also known as Elamipretide) is a mitochondria‑targeting peptide studied for its potential role in supporting mitochondrial membrane stability and cellular resilience. Wellness communities discuss SS‑31 for energy balance, recovery, and longevity support, though research remains preliminary and primarily in clinical or experimental settings.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 2–5 mg per day, though human protocols vary
• Some individuals use intermittent rather than continuous dosing

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 2–5 mg subcutaneously daily for several days or weeks depending on goals
• Often cycled due to its experimental nature

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Refrigerate after reconstitution

Notes:
• Considered an advanced peptide due to limited widespread human research
• Often explored by individuals focused on longevity or mitochondrial wellness

Disclaimer:

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide.
Epitalon
Category: Longevity Peptide • Telomere Support • Sleep & Aging Wellness

Description:
Epitalon (Epithalamin derivative) is a peptide studied in Russian longevity research for its potential role in circadian regulation, cellular aging support, and sleep‑wake rhythm balance. Users in wellness environments often explore Epitalon for perceived support of restorative sleep or overall vitality.

Effects vary widely, and research is still evolving.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 5–10 mg per day
• Cycled 10–20 days per month

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 10 mg subcutaneous injection before bedtime for 10–20 days
• Some users repeat cycles several times per year

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Store reconstituted peptide in the refrigerator

Notes:
• Often paired with good sleep hygiene practices
• May take time to observe subjective effects

Disclaimer:
This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Epitalon is not FDA‑approved for longevity, anti‑aging, or sleep enhancement.

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide.
GHK‑Cu
Category: Copper Peptide • Skin Regeneration • Anti‑Aging Support

Description:
GHK‑Cu is a naturally occurring copper‑binding peptide widely discussed in skincare and wellness routines. It is known for its potential role in supporting collagen appearance, skin smoothness, and general tissue wellness. GHK‑Cu is used in topical formulations, injectables, and microneedling routines.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• Topical: concentrations vary from 0.5%–2%
• Injectable (research settings): 1–5 mg, 1–3× weekly

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• For injectables: 2–5 mg subcutaneously, 1–3× weekly in wellness cycles
• For topical use: daily application to target areas

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection or topical cream/serum
• Store injectables refrigerated after reconstitution

Notes:
• Popular in aesthetic wellness routines
• Effects may include improved skin appearance or texture
