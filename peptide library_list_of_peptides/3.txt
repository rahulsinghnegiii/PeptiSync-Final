PeptiSync – Sexual Wellness Peptides (Document 5)
PT-141 (Bremelanotide)
Category: Sexual Wellness Peptide • Libido Support • Arousal Regulation

Description:
PT-141 (Bremelanotide) is a melanocortin receptor agonist discussed in wellness environments for its potential role in supporting libido, sexual arousal, and mood. Unlike traditional PDE5 medications that target blood flow, PT-141 works through neuronal pathways associated with desire and motivation. Effects vary significantly among individuals.

PT-141 is known for having a more “central” effect, meaning it influences brain signaling related to arousal rather than physical blood flow alone.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 0.5–2.0 mg per use
• Some individuals begin with 0.5–1 mg to assess sensitivity

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 1 mg subcutaneous injection approximately 30–90 minutes prior to desired effect window
• Some users titrate between 0.5–2 mg depending on comfort and response

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Store reconstituted peptide in the refrigerator

Notes:
• May cause flushing or nausea in some individuals
• Not a daily-use peptide; typically used intermittently
• Effects can be stronger in women than men in wellness reports

Disclaimer:
This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. PT-141 is not FDA-approved for enhancement of libido or arousal outside of its specific prescription form (Bremelanotide), and research-peptide versions are not approved for medical treatment.

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide or sexual wellness product.
Oxytocin
Category: Peptide Hormone • Bonding & Mood Support • Wellness Peptide

Description:
Oxytocin is a naturally occurring peptide hormone associated with bonding, emotional connection, and feelings of closeness. In wellness environments, individuals explore supplemental oxytocin for potential support of mood, intimacy, and relationship-connected wellbeing. Effects are subtle and vary widely.

Oxytocin is not considered a performance-enhancing compound but may support emotional presence or relaxation during intimate moments.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 10–24 IU intranasally
• Some individuals use 10 IU as an introductory dose

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 10–24 IU intranasally 10–30 minutes before social or intimate interactions
• Not typically used daily

Administration:
• Intranasal spray
• Store according to supplier instructions, often refrigerated

Notes:
• Provides subtle emotional effects rather than strong physiological changes
• Not recommended for individuals with certain medical or psychological conditions unless supervised

Disclaimer:
This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Oxytocin used as a research peptide is not FDA-approved for wellness, mood regulation, or intimacy enhancement.

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide.
