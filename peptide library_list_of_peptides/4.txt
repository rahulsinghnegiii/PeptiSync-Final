PeptiSync – Nootropic & Cognitive Peptides (Document 3)
Semax
Category: Nootropic Peptide • Cognitive Support • Focus & Mental Clarity

Description:
Semax is a synthetic peptide derived from a fragment of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). In wellness settings, individuals explore Semax for its potential role in supporting focus, mental clarity, productivity, and learning. It is considered a nootropic-style peptide, with many users describing subtle cognitive support during work, studying, or high-focus periods.

Semax is commonly administered intranasally, providing fast absorption through nasal pathways. Experiences vary widely depending on individual neurochemistry, lifestyle, and usage routines.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 300–1,000 mcg per dose
• Often used 1–3 times daily depending on cognitive demands

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 500 mcg intranasally in the morning
• Optional second dose in the afternoon during periods of high cognitive load
• Cycles range from 5–14 days, followed by rest periods

Administration:
• Intranasal spray or drops
• Store according to supplier instructions, often refrigerated after reconstitution

Notes:
• Some individuals report enhanced focus or reduced mental fatigue
• Effects are subjective and vary significantly
• Occasionally paired with Selank for a calm-focus combination
