PeptiSync – Healing & Regenerative Peptides (Document 2)
BPC‑157
Category: Healing Peptide • Tissue Support • Gut & Soft‑Tissue Wellness

Description:
BPC‑157 is a synthetic peptide fragment derived from a naturally occurring protein found in the stomach. In wellness settings, individuals explore BPC‑157 for its potential role in supporting soft‑tissue recovery, tendon comfort, and general wellness during physical activity. Some users also describe perceived digestive harmony or reduced local discomfort when BPC‑157 is included in a broader recovery routine.

Research is still developing, and effects vary widely among users due to differences in activity level, wellness status, and dose tolerance.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 200–500 mcg once or twice daily
• Some wellness routines use ~250 mcg daily for general support

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 200–500 mcg subcutaneously near the area of discomfort, once or twice daily
• Some individuals follow 2–4 week cycles

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection (near target area if desired)
• Rotate injection sites regularly
• Store reconstituted vials in the refrigerator

Notes:
• Often discussed in combination with TB‑500, though stacking should be clinician‑guided
• Effects, when present, may build gradually
• Wellness users frequently combine BPC‑157 with stretching, physical therapy, or mobility work

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide.
TB‑500
Category: Regenerative Peptide • Tissue Mobility • Recovery Support

Description:
TB‑500 is a synthetic version of thymosin beta‑4, a protein involved in cell migration and tissue support. In wellness environments, individuals explore TB‑500 for perceived benefits related to flexibility, movement comfort, and post‑activity recovery. It is widely discussed in performance and athletic communities.

Experiences vary, and TB‑500 is often used as part of a multi‑week wellness cycle rather than short-term use.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• Loading phase: 2.0–2.5 mg twice weekly for several weeks
• Maintenance: 2.0–2.5 mg weekly or biweekly

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• Weeks 1–4: 2.5 mg twice weekly
• Weeks 5+: 2.5 mg every 1–2 weeks for maintenance

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Some users inject near areas of tension or discomfort
• Store reconstituted vials in the refrigerator

Notes:
• Often paired with BPC‑157 for broader recovery routines
• May support mobility-focused wellness programs
• Users frequently combine TB‑500 with stretching and physical training

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide.
LL‑37
Category: Antimicrobial Peptide • Immune & Tissue Support

Description:
LL‑37 is a naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide involved in innate immune system signaling. In wellness spaces, LL‑37 is sometimes explored for its potential role in supporting general immune balance and tissue wellness, although experiences vary and research is still developing.

Because LL‑37 affects immune pathways, wellness use should be approached cautiously and ideally under professional guidance.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• Highly variable; 100–500 mcg administered intermittently in wellness routines

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• Short intermittent cycles (for example, 2–3 times per week) are commonly discussed in wellness communities

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Rotate injection sites regularly
• Refrigerate after reconstitution

Notes:
• May cause sensitivity reactions in some individuals
• Due to immune‑modulating properties, clinician oversight is strongly recommended

Disclaimer:
This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. LL‑37 is not FDA‑approved for immune treatment or antimicrobial therapy.

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide.
KPV
Category: Anti‑Inflammatory Support Peptide • Immune & Tissue Comfort

Description:
KPV is a short peptide fragment derived from the alpha‑MSH hormone and is discussed in wellness environments for its potential role in supporting inflammation balance, skin comfort, and gut wellness. Individuals exploring KPV often include it as part of wellness routines focused on comfort and recovery.

Individual responses vary, and effects may develop gradually.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 200–500 mcg once or twice daily
• Some individuals use oral or capsule versions depending on supplier

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 250–500 mcg subcutaneously once or twice daily
• Cycles commonly range from 2–6 weeks

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Oral versions also exist in some wellness settings
• Store according to supplier guidance

Notes:
• Sometimes paired with BPC‑157 or TB‑500 in wellness stacks
• Users often report mild effects related to comfort or calmness

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide or supplement.
ARA‑290
Category: Tissue & Nerve Wellness Peptide • Anti‑Inflammatory Support

Description:
ARA‑290 (also called Cibinetide) is a peptide studied for its potential interaction with receptors involved in inflammation regulation and nerve health. In wellness settings, individuals explore ARA‑290 for perceived support of comfort, nerve balance, or tissue wellness—though human data are limited.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 2 mg administered several times per week in wellness-style routines

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 1–2 mg subcutaneously, 2–3× weekly for several weeks
• Cycles vary widely as research is still developing

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Rotate injection sites
• Refrigerate after reconstitution
