PeptiSync – Growth Hormone System Peptides (Document 6)
CJC-1295 DAC
Category: GHRH Analog • Long-Acting GH Support • Wellness Peptide

Description:
CJC-1295 DAC is a long-acting growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) analog. In wellness settings, individuals explore CJC-1295 DAC for perceived support of recovery, body composition, sleep quality, and general vitality. Because of the DAC (Drug Affinity Complex), this peptide has an extended half-life, allowing for less frequent administration.

CJC-1295 DAC encourages the body to release its own growth hormone rather than supplying GH directly, making it a more “upstream” wellness tool.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 1–2 mg once weekly
• Some use 2 mg every 5–7 days

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 1–2 mg subcutaneously once weekly
• Cycled for 8–12 weeks with rest periods

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Refrigerate after reconstitution

Notes:
• Often paired with Ipamorelin to support synergistic GH release
• May influence recovery and sleep in some individuals

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide.
CJC-1295 (No DAC)
Category: GHRH Analog • Short-Acting GH Support • Wellness Peptide

Description:
CJC-1295 (No DAC) is a shorter-acting version of the GHRH analog without the long-lasting DAC modification. It is often used in wellness settings for its potential to support natural pulses of growth hormone when paired with GH secretagogues like Ipamorelin.

Because it has a short half-life, it is commonly administered multiple times per week or daily depending on the routine.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 100–200 mcg per dose
• Often combined in equal ratio with Ipamorelin

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 100–200 mcg subcutaneously 1–3× daily
• Common timing: morning, post-workout, or before bed

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Refrigerate after reconstitution

Notes:
• Often stacked with Ipamorelin for synergistic GH release
• Works with the body’s natural GH pulsatility

Disclaimer:

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide.
Ipamorelin
Category: GH Secretagogue • Appetite-Neutral • Recovery & Vitality Support

Description:
Ipamorelin is a selective GH secretagogue frequently used in wellness environments to support recovery, body composition routines, and energy balance. It stimulates the release of growth hormone without significantly affecting appetite, making it popular in wellness stacks.

Ipamorelin is often paired with CJC-1295 No DAC to mimic natural GH pulses.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 100–300 mcg per dose
• Administered 1–3× daily

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 200 mcg subcutaneously before bed
• Or 100–200 mcg morning + bedtime

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Refrigerate after reconstitution

Notes:
• Often used for recovery, sleep support, and general wellness
• Considered gentler than older GH secretagogues

Disclaimer:
This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Ipamorelin is not FDA-approved for GH enhancement or anti-aging.

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide.
GHRP-2
Category: GH Secretagogue • Appetite-Stimulating • Advanced Wellness Peptide

Description:
GHRP-2 is a potent GH secretagogue that promotes the natural release of growth hormone. In wellness settings, individuals explore GHRP-2 for recovery, vitality, and metabolic support. Compared to Ipamorelin, GHRP-2 often produces a stronger GH response but can increase hunger in some individuals.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 100–300 mcg per dose
• 1–3× daily depending on goals

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 100–200 mcg subcutaneously before meals or bedtime

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Refrigerate after reconstitution

Notes:
• Stronger GH release than Ipamorelin
• Increased hunger is common
• Often paired with GHRH analogs like CJC-1295 No DAC

Disclaimer:
This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. GHRP-2 is not FDA-approved for GH enhancement or anti-aging.

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide.
GHRP-6
Category: GH Secretagogue • High Appetite Response • Wellness Peptide

Description:
GHRP-6 is similar to GHRP-2 but typically produces more noticeable hunger signals. Individuals in wellness environments sometimes explore GHRP-6 to support recovery, energy balance, or body composition routines. It is considered one of the strongest GH secretagogues.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 100–300 mcg per dose
• 1–3× daily

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 100–200 mcg subcutaneously before meals or bedtime

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Refrigerate after reconstitution

Notes:
• Known for strong appetite-stimulating effects
• Often used in combination with CJC-1295 No DAC

Disclaimer:
This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. GHRP-6 is not FDA-approved for GH enhancement or anti-aging.

Medical Safety Notice:
Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or combining any peptide.
Sermorelin
Category: GHRH Analog • GH Pulsatility Support • Wellness Peptide

Description:
Sermorelin is a growth hormone–releasing hormone analog used in wellness contexts to support natural GH production. It promotes more physiological GH pulses compared to direct GH administration.

Sermorelin is commonly used for general vitality, recovery, and sleep wellness.

Commonly Reported Dosing Ranges (Wellness Settings):
• 100–300 mcg per dose
• Generally taken before bedtime

Typical Protocol (Educational Purposes Only):
• 200–300 mcg subcutaneously nightly for 8–12 weeks

Administration:
• Subcutaneous injection
• Refrigerate after reconstitution

Notes:
• Often paired with GH secretagogues such as Ipamorelin or GHRP-2
• Some individuals report improved sleep quality

Disclaimer:
This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Sermorelin is not FDA-approved for anti-aging or GH enhancement when used as a research peptide.
