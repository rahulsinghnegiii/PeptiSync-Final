# 🔧 Render Deployment Troubleshooting

## ❌ Error: "vite: not found"

### Problem:
```
> vite_react_shadcn_ts@0.0.0 build
> vite build
sh: 1: vite: not found
==> Build failed 😞
```

### Root Cause:
Vite was in `devDependencies` but Render doesn't install dev dependencies by default in production builds.

### ✅ Solution Applied:
1. **Moved build-essential packages to `dependencies`:**
   - `vite`
   - `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`
   - `typescript`
   - `tailwindcss`
   - `autoprefixer`
   - `postcss`

2. **Updated build command:**
   - Changed from `npm install` to `npm ci` for more reliable installs

3. **Added Node version specification:**
   - Created `.nvmrc` file with Node 18.18.0

---

## 🚀 How to Redeploy

### Option 1: Automatic Redeploy
Since auto-deploy is enabled, Render will automatically redeploy when it detects the new commit.

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Find your service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

---

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
- [x] Vite moved to production dependencies
- [x] Build command updated to `npm ci && npm run build`
- [x] Node version specified (18.18.0)
- [x] All build tools available in production

### 🔍 What to Monitor:
1. **Build Logs:** Should now show successful Vite build
2. **Install Phase:** Should install all dependencies including Vite
3. **Build Phase:** Should complete without "not found" errors
4. **Deploy Phase:** Should serve the built files

## 🔧 Additional Fixes Applied

### Package.json Updates:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // Runtime dependencies
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "vite": "^5.4.19",           // ← Moved from devDependencies
    "typescript": "^5.8.3",      // ← Moved from devDependencies
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",    // ← Moved from devDependencies
    // ... other dependencies
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // Development-only tools
    "eslint": "^9.32.0",
    "@types/node": "^22.16.5",
    // ... other dev dependencies
  }
}
```

### Render.yaml Updates:
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: peptisync-nova
    env: static
    buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build  # ← Changed from npm install

## 🚨 Common Render Deployment Issues

### 1. Build Dependencies Missing
**Error:** `command not found` for build tools
**Solution:** Move build tools to `dependencies`

### 2. Node Version Mismatch
**Error:** Build fails with version-related errors
**Solution:** Add `.nvmrc` file or specify in render.yaml

### 3. Environment Variables Missing
**Error:** App loads but features don't work
**Solution:** Set all VITE_ prefixed variables in Render dashboard

### 4. Static Files Not Found
**Error:** 404 for assets or routing issues
**Solution:** Verify `staticPublishPath: ./dist` in render.yaml

### 5. Build Timeout
**Error:** Build takes too long and times out
**Solution:** Optimize dependencies or upgrade Render plan

## 📊 Monitoring Your Deployment

### Build Logs Location:
1. Render Dashboard → Your Service → "Logs" tab
2. Filter by "Build" to see build-specific logs
3. Filter by "Deploy" to see deployment logs

### Key Metrics to Watch:
- **Build Time:** Should be under 5 minutes
- **Bundle Size:** Check for large assets
- **Memory Usage:** Monitor during build
- **Deploy Time:** Should be under 1 minute

---

## 🔄 If Issues Persist

### 1. Clear Build Cache:
```bash
# In Render dashboard, trigger a "Clear build cache & deploy"
```

### 2. Check Dependencies:
```bash
# Locally test the build
npm ci
npm run build
```

### 3. Verify Environment:
- Node version matches (.nvmrc)
- All required packages in dependencies
- Build command is correct

### 4. Alternative Build Commands:
If issues persist, try these in render.yaml:
```yaml
buildCommand: npm install --production=false && npm run build
# or
buildCommand: yarn install && yarn build
```
