# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing and enhancing the PeptiSync e-commerce website. PeptiSync is a peptide tracking and e-commerce platform that allows users to browse products, manage their cart, place orders, and track shipments. The platform includes user authentication, role-based access control, and an admin panel for managing products, orders, and users.

The current implementation has a solid foundation with React, TypeScript, Supabase, and shadcn/ui components. However, several critical features are incomplete or missing, including proper checkout flow, payment integration, order management, product inventory management, and various user experience enhancements.
