# Requirements Document: Clerk Authentication Migration

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the PeptiSync website from Supabase Auth to Clerk authentication. Clerk is a modern authentication and user management platform that provides a comprehensive set of features including social logins, multi-factor authentication, and advanced user management capabilities. This migration will maintain all existing security features while leveraging Clerk's enhanced authentication capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Authentication Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Supabase Auth to Clerk, so that we can leverage Clerk's advanced authentication features and better user management capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN Clerk SHALL be initialized with proper configuration
2. WHEN a user signs up THEN Clerk SHALL handle the registration process with email verification
3. WHEN a user signs in THEN Clerk SHALL authenticate the user and provide session management
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN Clerk SHALL properly terminate the session and clear authentication state
5. IF a user is authenticated THEN the application SHALL have access to the user's Clerk profile data
6. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the application SHALL update the UI accordingly

### Requirement 2: User Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user data synchronized between Clerk and Supabase, so that existing database relationships and user profiles remain functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up via Clerk THEN a corresponding profile SHALL be created in the Supabase profiles table
2. WHEN a user updates their profile in Clerk THEN the Supabase profile SHALL be updated via webhook
3. WHEN a user is deleted in Clerk THEN the corresponding Supabase data SHALL be handled according to data retention policies
4. IF a user already exists in Supabase THEN the migration SHALL link their existing data to their new Clerk ID
5. WHEN user metadata is updated THEN both Clerk and Supabase SHALL maintain consistency

### Requirement 3: Protected Routes and Authorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my access to protected pages to be controlled by my authentication status and role, so that I can only access features I'm authorized to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected route THEN they SHALL be redirected to the sign-in page
2. WHEN an authenticated user accesses a protected route THEN they SHALL be granted access
3. WHEN a user without admin role tries to access admin pages THEN they SHALL be denied access
4. IF a user's session expires THEN they SHALL be automatically redirected to sign in
5. WHEN role-based permissions are checked THEN Clerk metadata SHALL be used for authorization

### Requirement 4: Social Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in using my social media accounts (Google, GitHub, etc.), so that I can quickly access the platform without creating a new password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a social login button THEN Clerk SHALL initiate the OAuth flow
2. WHEN social authentication succeeds THEN the user SHALL be signed in and redirected to the dashboard
3. WHEN a user signs in with a social provider for the first time THEN a new account SHALL be created
4. IF a user's email matches an existing account THEN Clerk SHALL handle account linking appropriately
5. WHEN social authentication fails THEN the user SHALL see an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to enable multi-factor authentication on my account, so that my account has an additional layer of security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables MFA in their settings THEN Clerk SHALL guide them through the setup process
2. WHEN a user with MFA enabled signs in THEN they SHALL be prompted for their second factor
3. WHEN MFA verification succeeds THEN the user SHALL be granted access
4. IF MFA verification fails THEN the user SHALL be prompted to try again
5. WHEN a user disables MFA THEN they SHALL be required to verify their identity first

### Requirement 6: Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to be managed securely, so that I remain signed in across page refreshes but am automatically signed out after extended inactivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in THEN Clerk SHALL create a secure session
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN their session SHALL persist
3. WHEN a user is inactive for 30 minutes THEN they SHALL receive a warning
4. WHEN a user is inactive for 35 minutes THEN they SHALL be automatically signed out
5. WHEN a user signs out THEN all session data SHALL be cleared

### Requirement 7: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile information through Clerk's interface, so that I can update my personal details and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile settings THEN they SHALL see Clerk's user profile component
2. WHEN a user updates their name or email THEN the changes SHALL be saved to Clerk
3. WHEN a user changes their password THEN Clerk SHALL enforce password strength requirements
4. WHEN profile changes are saved THEN the Supabase profile SHALL be updated via webhook
5. IF profile update fails THEN the user SHALL see an appropriate error message

### Requirement 8: Email Verification and Password Reset

**User Story:** As a user, I want to verify my email address and reset my password if I forget it, so that I can maintain secure access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN Clerk SHALL send a verification email
2. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN their email SHALL be marked as verified
3. WHEN a user requests a password reset THEN Clerk SHALL send a reset email
4. WHEN a user clicks the reset link THEN they SHALL be able to set a new password
5. WHEN password reset succeeds THEN the user SHALL be able to sign in with the new password

### Requirement 9: Webhook Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Clerk events to trigger updates in our Supabase database, so that user data remains synchronized across systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is created in Clerk THEN a webhook SHALL trigger profile creation in Supabase
2. WHEN a user is updated in Clerk THEN a webhook SHALL trigger profile updates in Supabase
3. WHEN a user is deleted in Clerk THEN a webhook SHALL trigger appropriate cleanup in Supabase
4. IF a webhook fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN webhook processing completes THEN the system SHALL log the event for auditing

### Requirement 10: Migration Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear migration path from Supabase Auth to Clerk, so that existing users can transition smoothly without losing access to their accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration begins THEN existing user data SHALL be backed up
2. WHEN users first sign in after migration THEN they SHALL be prompted to verify their email with Clerk
3. WHEN user data is migrated THEN all existing orders, cart items, and reviews SHALL remain linked
4. IF a user cannot be migrated automatically THEN they SHALL receive instructions to create a new account
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN all Supabase Auth code SHALL be removed

### Requirement 11: Maintain Existing Security Features

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all existing security features to remain functional after the Clerk migration, so that the application maintains its security posture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN role-based authorization SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN forms are submitted THEN input sanitization SHALL still prevent XSS attacks
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN CSRF protection SHALL remain active
4. WHEN database queries execute THEN RLS policies SHALL continue to enforce data access rules
5. WHEN sessions timeout THEN users SHALL be automatically signed out as before

### Requirement 12: Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and type-safe APIs for working with Clerk, so that I can efficiently build and maintain authentication features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
